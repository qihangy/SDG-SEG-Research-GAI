# SDG-SEG-Research-GAI

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ratified by the United Nations on 15 September 2015, have been described<br/>
as “the closest thing the Earth has to a strategy” (PwC, 2017). It is also widely acknowledged that the 2 goals set for<br/>
2030 cannot be achieved by the public sector alone . The investment community is increasingly seeing the SDGs as creating<br/>
investment opportunities and corporations are looking for the business opportunities they create.<br/>

The data comes from the data team who used NLP to calculte the sentiment score of the SDG from the WRDS Database. The  <br/>
QIhang_sdg_131415 py file analyze the relationship between the SDG score and the equty return. In order to better  <br/>
understand  the data. I divide the tickers into the small, medium, and large size groups to compare their overall short run <br/> staleness calculated in a new way, which measures the number of observations in the previous seven days. 852 global companies in the sample are considered in this analysis, and they are assigned to each bucket according to the criteria under<br/>
New_Global. There is not much difference across the size groups. This is because the companies in our sample, which<br/>
are the companies either in the benchmark and pension fund portfolio with size data are significantly larger than <br/>
the total sample we used to look at before.<br/>
