# SDG-SEG-Research-GAI

The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ratified by the United Nations on 15 September 2015, have been described<br/>
as “the closest thing the Earth has to a strategy” (PwC, 2017). It is also widely acknowledged that the 2 goals set for<br/>
2030 cannot be achieved by the public sector alone . The investment community is increasingly seeing the SDGs as creating<br/>
investment opportunities and corporations are looking for the business opportunities they create.<br/>

Now I divide the tickers into the small, medium, and large size groups to compare their overall short run staleness <br/>
calculated in a new way, which measures the number of observations in the previous seven days. 852 global companies <br/>
in the sample are considered in this analysis, and they are assigned to each bucket according to the criteria under<br/>
New_Global. There is not much difference across the size groups. This is because the companies in our sample, which<br/>
are the companies either in the benchmark and pension fund portfolio with size data are significantly larger than <br/>
the total sample we used to look at before.<br/>
